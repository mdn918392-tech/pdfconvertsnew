      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rotate specific pages or only the entire PDF?",

      {
        "question": "Which browsers work best for PDF rotation on Android?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Are there file size limitations?",
        "answer": "Most web tools support up to 50MB files on mobile. Cloud services like Google Drive have higher limits based on your storage plan. Email attachments are typically limited to 25MB. For very large files, consider using Wi-Fi connection."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I rotate scanned PDF documents?",
        "answer": "Yes, all these methods work with scanned PDFs. However, scanned documents are essentially images, so the rotation is applied to the entire image. Text recognition (OCR) features are not typically available in web-based rotation tools."

      {
        "question": "What is the difference between rotating a PDF page and rotating an image?",
        "answer": "Rotating a PDF page changes the orientation of a page inside a document while preserving text, layout, and structure. Rotating an image only affects a single picture file and does not retain document formatting like selectable text or multiple pages."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why does rotating an image not fix PDF rotation issues?",
        "answer": "PDFs store rotation data differently from images. Rotating an image only changes pixels, while PDFs rely on page-level rotation metadata. This is why image rotation tools cannot permanently fix PDF orientation problems."
      },
      {
        "question": "When should I rotate a PDF instead of converting it to an image?",
        "answer": "You should rotate a PDF directly when the document contains text, multiple pages, or needs to remain searchable and printable. Converting to images reduces quality and removes text selection."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does rotating a PDF affect file quality?",
        "answer": "No, rotating PDF pages does not reduce quality because it only updates orientation metadata. Image rotation may cause quality loss if the file is re-encoded."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which is better for documents: PDF rotation or image rotation?",

    },

      "answer": "JPG is best for photographs and realistic images with smooth color transitions. PNG is better for images with text, sharp edges, transparency, or when you need lossless quality. JPG has smaller file sizes but uses lossy compression."

    },
    {
      "question": "What format should I use for printing?",
      "answer": "For professional printing: PDF (print-ready with fonts embedded). For photo printing: High-quality JPG or PNG. For large format printing: PDF or high-resolution PNG. Always use 300 DPI minimum for print quality."

      "answer": "Many times you only need a specific section - like a single chapter from a long report, just the application form from a document packet, or specific pages from a scanned book. Extracting pages 2-5 gives you exactly what you need without the rest of the document getting in the way."
    },
    {
      "question": "What if I need different pages, like 3-7 or 10-15?",
      "answer": "The same process works for any page range. You just select whatever pages you actually need. It's really handy when you only want part of a document, not the whole thing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does extracting pages 2-5 change the original PDF?",
      "answer": "No, your original document stays exactly the same. The extraction creates a brand new PDF with just the pages you selected. Your original file remains untouched, so you can always go back to it if needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I extract non-consecutive pages, like pages 2, 5, and 7?",
      "answer": "Yes, you can pick any pages you want, in any order. Some tools let you click individual pages, others let you type the page numbers you need. Either way, you get just the pages you actually want."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this useful for sharing files on WhatsApp or email?",
      "answer": "Very useful. Instead of sending a huge 50-page PDF when you only need 4 pages, you extract just pages 2-5 and send that smaller file. It loads faster, uses less data, and the person gets exactly what they need without scrolling through unrelated pages."

    },
    {
      "question": "What's the difference between PNG and JPG for screenshots?",
      "answer": "PNG screenshots are perfect quality but create larger files. JPG screenshots are smaller files that are easier to share. For most website screenshots that you're sharing or documenting, JPG works just fine and saves space."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I convert multiple screenshots at once?",
      "answer": "Yes, many conversion tools let you upload several screenshots and convert them all to JPG at the same time. This is handy when you've taken multiple screenshots of different website sections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will converting to JPG make my screenshot blurry?",
      "answer": "Not if you use good conversion settings. Most tools let you choose quality levels. For website screenshots, high-quality JPG conversion keeps everything clear and readable while still reducing file size."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this useful for social media posts?",
      "answer": "Very useful. Social media platforms often work better with JPG files. Converting your website screenshot to JPG before posting can make it upload faster and display better on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram."

    },
    {
      "question": "What image formats can I combine into a PDF?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Will the image quality get worse when combined into PDF?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is this useful for things like printing photo collages?",

      "question": "What's the main difference between portrait and landscape?",
      "answer": "Portrait is taller than wide – like holding your phone normally to read a message. Landscape is wider than tall – like turning your phone sideways to watch a video. In practice, portrait works better for reading text line by line, while landscape works better for wide content like spreadsheets or photos."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will changing orientation affect my PDF quality?",
      "answer": "Not at all. Changing orientation just rotates how the content is displayed. All your text, images, and formatting stay exactly the same quality – they're just arranged differently on the page. It's like turning a painting on the wall: the painting doesn't change, just which way it faces."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I choose the wrong orientation?",
      "answer": "The content gets cut off when printing, or looks awkward on screen. Text might wrap strangely, images get squeezed, and people have to zoom and scroll more than they should. It's annoying but easy to fix. Most PDF tools let you rotate pages or change orientation after the fact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I have both orientations in one PDF?",
      "answer": "Yes, and this is something more people should use. You can have some pages in portrait and others in landscape within the same PDF. This is perfect for reports that mix text pages (portrait) with wide charts (landscape). The document flows naturally and each page shows its content in the best possible way."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does orientation matter for digital viewing?",
      "answer": "It matters more than people think. On phones, portrait orientation usually works better because that's how people hold their devices. On computers and tablets, it depends on the content. Wide tables need landscape even on screens. The key is to think about how people will actually view the document, not just how it prints."
