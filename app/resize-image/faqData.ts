      question: "How does the image resizer work?",
      answer: "Our image resizer works entirely in your browser. You upload images, set your desired dimensions and quality settings, and the tool resizes them locally without uploading to any server. This ensures your privacy and fast processing."
    },
    {
      question: "What image formats are supported?",
      answer: "We support all common image formats including JPG, PNG, WebP, GIF, and BMP. The output can be saved as JPG, PNG, or WebP format."
    },
    {
      question: "Will resizing affect image quality?",
      answer: "Our resizer uses high-quality scaling algorithms to minimize quality loss. You can adjust the quality slider to balance file size and visual quality. For enlarging images, some quality loss is inevitable as we cannot create new pixels."
    },
    {
      question: "What does 'Maintain Aspect Ratio' mean?",
      answer: "When enabled, the image will be resized proportionally to prevent distortion. If you set dimensions that don't match the original aspect ratio, the tool will automatically adjust one dimension to maintain proportions."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I resize multiple images at once?",
      answer: "Yes! You can upload and resize multiple images simultaneously. All images will be resized to the same dimensions you specify. You can then download them individually or as a single ZIP file."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many images I can resize?",
      answer: "There's no hard limit, but performance may vary based on your device's capabilities. For best results, we recommend resizing up to 50 images at once. All processing happens in your browser."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the maximum dimensions I can set?",
      answer: "You can set dimensions up to 10,000 pixels on each side. However, very large dimensions may cause browser performance issues. We recommend keeping dimensions under 4000x4000 pixels for optimal performance."
    },
    {
      question: "Does resizing reduce file size?",
      answer: "Yes, reducing image dimensions typically reduces file size, especially when combined with quality optimization. Smaller images have fewer pixels, which means smaller file sizes."
    }
